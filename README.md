A python ML project for predicting the NBA MVP, see the demo here: https://youtu.be/SUfzc1utcWo
To build this I utilized Python, Web-Scraping, pandas, scikit, Machine Learning, ridge regression, and random forest regression  
All the data was scraped from Basketball Reference, cleaned, and models ran on with pandas and scikit.  
Error testing was conducted to tweak the models, and random forest ended out on top
